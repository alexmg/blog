JetBrains has provided developers with an early Christmas present releasing the ReSharper 5.0 Beta on Christmas Eve. It looks there are plenty of new features to take for a test drive.

> ReSharper 5.0 Beta introduces a great **web development** feature set; **code analysis** extended with call tracking, value tracking, and foreach-to-LINQ transformations; **project-level refactorings**; and a lot more enjoyable features.

The Beta version will work with both Visual Studio 2010 and Visual Studio 2008, although according to [this post](http://blogs.jetbrains.com/dotnet/2009/12/resharper-50-beta-comes-out/) from JetBrains there are a number of known issues causing problems with support for Visual Studio 2010 Beta 2.

> However, keep in mind that Visual Studio 2010 Beta 2 has a number of known issues that in certain scenarios prevent ReSharper from working well. Don’t worry too much though: it doesn’t mean your Visual Studio crashes every time you press Alt+Enter! JetBrains and Microsoft
> engineers are aware of the problems and working together to solve them by the time Visual Studio 2010 goes RTM.

Head on over to the [What's New in ReSharper 5.0 Beta](http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/beta/beta.html) page for a download link and more information on the new features.
