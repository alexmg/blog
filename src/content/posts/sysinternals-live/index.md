If you aren’t already familiar with the [Sysinternals](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/default.aspx) tools then you must go and check them out. They are of invaluable assistance when it comes to troubleshooting problems and gaining insight into what is happening on your machine.

I use these tools nearly every daily and would often return to the Sysinternals site looking to see if updates were available. With the launch of the [Sysinternals Live](http://live.sysinternals.com/) service the whole suite of tools are now accessible directly off the internet.

> Sysinternals Live is a service that enables you to execute Sysinternals tools directly from the Web without hunting for and manually downloading them. Simply enter a tool’s Sysinternals Live path into Windows Explorer or a command prompt as http://live.sysinternals.com/\{toolname\} or \\\\live.sysinternals.com\\tools\\\{toolname\}.

Here are some of my favourite tools:

- If you do any presentation work then [ZoomIt](http://live.sysinternals.com/ZoomIt.exe) is a must have.
- Monitor the registry, file system and network using [Process Monitor](http://live.sysinternals.com/Procmon.exe).
- [Process Explorer](http://live.sysinternals.com/procexp.exe) is a great alternative to the Windows Task Manager.
- [TCPView](http://live.sysinternals.com/Tcpview.exe) is great for monitoring network connections.
- Executing a process on a local or remote machine is easy with [PsExec](http://live.sysinternals.com/psexec.exe).
- Kill a process on a local or remote machine using [PsKill](http://live.sysinternals.com/pskill.exe).
- Shutdown and reboot machines using [PsShutdown](http://live.sysinternals.com/psshutdown.exe).
- See what files other computers have opened on your machine using [PsFile](http://live.sysinternals.com/psfile.exe).

There are many more tools to play with and you will likely find something you always wanted but never knew existed.
