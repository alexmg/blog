Make sure you have a [listen](http://www.talkingshopdownunder.com/2010/04/episode-8-nick-blumhardt-and-autofac-20.html) to [Nicholas Blumhardt](http://nblumhardt.com/) talking about Autofac 2 on the [Talking Shop Down Under](http://www.talkingshopdownunder.com/) podcast.

> It's Inversion of Control Time! This week Nick Blumhardt talks about IoC containers in general, the problems with the service locator pattern and why constructor injection is considered a better choice, a little about how MEF and Autofac differ in purpose and a lot about Autofac 2's new features.

Nick was also a guest on [.NET Rocks!](http://www.dotnetrocks.com/) last year, and that
[episode](http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?showNum=450) is definitely worth listening to as well.

> The .NET dudes talk to Nicholas Blumhardt about Autofac, an IoC container that uses lambda expressions in C\# 3.0 to create components.

Keep spreading the good word Nick!
