It felt like the Beta was offering performance improvements but in the end has been completely unusable for me. I have experienced Visual Studio hangs or excessive CPU consumption after performing builds, during debugging and at various points when navigating around the solution. After rolling back to version 4.1 I haven’t had any problems. Fingers crossed that the quality increases dramatically before the final release.
