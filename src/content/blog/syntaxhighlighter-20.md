I was pleased to find out that a new version of [SyntaxHighlighter](http://alexgorbatchev.com/wiki/SyntaxHighlighter) has been released. New features including smart line wrapping, 100% standards compliance, additional themes and hosted versions of the source files. The documentation on the new wiki is also very good. It is obvious that [Alex Gorbatchev](http://www.sameshirteveryday.com/) has put a lot of effort into this release and should be commended. Below is a little “hello world” sample highlighted using the new version:

```csharp
using System;

namespace HelloWorld
{
    /// <summary>
    /// A "Hello World!" program in C#.
    /// </summary>
    class Hello
    {
        /// <summary>
        /// The main entry point.
        /// </summary>
        static void Main()
        {
            System.Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
        }
    }
}
```
