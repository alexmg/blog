On the last day of September in 2009 we released the first version of [WSCF.blue](http://wscfblue.codeplex.com/) on CodePlex. I was very pleased to see that there has now been more than 1000 downloads of the V1 release. Congratulations to the team and thank you to everyone who has downloaded WSCF.blue. It is great to see that interest in contract-fist development is still alive and well. Of course, [Christian](http://blogs.thinktecture.com/cweyer/) and [Buddhike](http://blogs.thinktecture.com/buddhike) did a great job of spreading the word with their excellent [MSDN article](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/ee335699.aspx).

Now that everyone is back from holidays and feeling refreshed there is no doubt work will continue on the next version. We all have plenty of ideas for the features we would like to see, but what we would really like is feedback from the community on what you want. If you have ideas on what you would like to see in future versions of WSCF.blue please jump onto the [forum](http://wscfblue.codeplex.com/Thread/List.aspx) and let us know.
