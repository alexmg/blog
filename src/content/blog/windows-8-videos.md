title: Windows 8 Videos
description: Microsoft introduced Windows 8 at the D9 and Computex conferences, but the upgrade won't be available until next year. Android Honeycomb 3.1 is currently out, making it a better option for tablet users looking to buy now. There are two videos on Youtube providing a sneak peak of Windows 8.

It looks like the recent rumours were indeed true. The first official previews of Windows 8 are starting to surface from the [D9](http://www.microsoft.com/Presspass/Features/2011/jun11/06-01corporatenews.aspx) and [Computex](http://www.microsoft.com/Presspass/press/2011/jun11/06-01Win8PreviewPR.mspx) conferences. It appears that just like the conferences the focus is all on tablet devices.

> Today, at the D9 Conference, we demonstrated the next generation of Windows, internally code-named “Windows 8,” for the first time. Windows 8 is a reimagining of Windows, from the chip to the interface. A Windows 8-based PC is really a new kind of device, one that scales from touch-only small screens through to large screens, with or without a keyboard and mouse.

If you are a Windows user looking to buy a tablet, do you buy a Windows 7 tablet now and upgrade to Windows 8 later? Running Windows 8 on the same hardware [shouldn’t be a problem](http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/229223/microsoft_windows_8_wont_require_a_new_pc.html), but your upgrade wont be happening until sometime next year. The Android Honeycomb 3.1 update has started to roll out, and more important than just being a good update, you can actually buy a tablet and start using it right now. It’s a shame that Microsoft are still so far away from making a serious venture (back) into the tablet market.
