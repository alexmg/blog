title: Contract-First article on MSDN
description: Christian and Buddhike wrote an excellent MSDN article on Schema-based Development with Windows Communication Foundation (WCF). It is focused on contract-first web service development and how it can be achieved with WCF. A diagram was created to illustrate the steps of the process and it highlights the iterative nature of the approach.

Congratulations to [Christian](http://blogs.thinktecture.com/cweyer/) and [Buddhike](http://blogs.thinktecture.com/buddhike) for their excellent MSDN article: [Schema-based Development with Windows Communication Foundation](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/ee335699.aspx). If you are new to contract-first web service development, or even if you have been practicing it for a while, I am sure you will really enjoy reading this article. It is great to see an article on MSDN that is focused on contract-first and how it can be achieved with WCF. Of course, there is a section dedicated to the [WSCF.blue](http://wscfblue.codeplex.com/) Visual Studio 2008 Add-in.

The diagram below was created for the article, and Christian has also put it on the WSCF.blue homepage on [CodePlex](http://www.codeplex.com/).

I really like this diagram, it paints a picture that is very clear and easy to understand. It shows that there is a sequence of steps that are undertaken when doing contract-first development, and highlights that this entire sequence becomes an iterative process. Well done guys!
