title: Upgrading through every version of windows
description: This is a great video showing the upgrades of all major Windows versions from MS-DOS 5.0 to Windows 7. It brings back memories of the past, such as installing Trumpet Winsock for Windows 3.0 and the screeching modem sound of Gopher sessions. The video can be found on YouTube.

This is a great video showing upgrades of all major Windows versions from 1 through to 7. In fact, the whole process starts with the installation of MS-DOS 5.0 before moving onto Windows. Monkey Island and Doom 2 are installed in MS-DOS to test the backwards compatibility of Windows. The level of legacy support that Microsoft has managed to maintain over such a long period of time is certainly impressive. This has definitely got to be a very heavy burden. You can [read more](http://rasteri.blogspot.com/2011/03/chain-of-fools-upgrading-through-every.html) about the whole process on the author’s blog.

Watching this certainly brings back a lot of memories. Looking at the DOS screens I quickly started to reminisce about how much I loved Norton Commander. There was no need to reach for the mouse and everything was just a quick tap of the keyboard away. I remember having to install Trumpet Winsock because Windows 3.0 didn’t support the TCP/IP protocol stack. Gone are the days of the screeching modem and the Gopher session. I never imagined I would have instant access to the internet on a phone that fit snuggly into my pocket. Anyway, that’s enough nostalgia from me, check the video out to bring back your own memories.
