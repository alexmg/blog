Since releasing the first Beta we have been busy working through the [issue list](http://code.google.com/p/autofac/issues/list) and have included a number of enhancements and bug fixes in [Beta 2](https://nuget.org/packages/Autofac). We are hoping this will be the last Beta before the final release, and will be putting a hold on changes in the meantime to the keep the codebase stable. It would be great to make the release available early in the new year, so please grab the latest packages and let us know if you have any problems.

## Changes

- Added `AutoActivate()` registration extension to flag components to be automatically resolved on container build.
- Added an `InterceptTransparentProxy` registration extension that allows transparent proxy instances to be intercepted using `ProxyGenerator.CreateInterfaceProxyWithTargetInterface`.
- Added `AutofacInstanceContext.Current` static method akin to the MVC `AutofacDependencyResolver.Current`. Made `OperationLifetime` publicly gettable to allow for `AutofacInstanceContext.Current.OperationLifetime` access.
- Added a `RegisterTypes` extension equivalent to `RegisterAssemblyTypes` but which allows you to pass in a specific list of types rather than simply scanning assemblies.
- Removed the now confusing (Beta) suffix from the MVC 4 and Web API integration NuGet package titles.
- The same registration can now be used to register a MVC and Web API filter. Multiple filter types on a single registration are also supported.
- Updated all dependencies to the latest versions.
- Switched Autofac.Extras.CommonServiceLocator to a portable class library.
