I stumbled across an interesting [response](https://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/feedback/ViewFeedback.aspx?FeedbackID=336467&wa=wsignin1.0) to an issue on [Microsoft Connect](https://connect.microsoft.com/default.aspx) and couldnâ€™t help but to laugh:

> As a workaround, your add-in might want to store these settings on a per-project basis, or alternatively, you could keep a small **turd** configuration file next to the .sln that has your settings.

Maybe I need to get some more sleep, but it certainly seems funny at the moment. ;p
