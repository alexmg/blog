The ReSharper 4.5 Beta is now available for [download](http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/beta.html). I have installed the new version and look forward to seeing how much of a performance improvement there is. The claimed improvements are outlined below.

I didnâ€™t have any problems with the installer which is always nice as the installer is technically a Beta version as well. The old version was removed and the new installed without issue.

Time to take her for a test drive...
