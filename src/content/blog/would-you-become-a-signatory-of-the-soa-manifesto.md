title: Would you become a signatory of the SOA Manifesto?
description: The SOA Manifesto is a manifesto similar to the Agile Manifesto, sparking debate and discussion. There is a SOA Manifesto Dialog site to voice opinions on it. Those who agree with the benefits of SOA should become signatories of the manifesto.

Most developers have heard of the [Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/), but did you know there is also a [SOA Manifesto](http://www.soa-manifesto.org/)? Like the Agile Manifesto, and perhaps even more so, I am sure it will be wide open to interpretation and will spark some level of debate. There is already a [SOA Manifesto Dialog](http://www.soamanifesto.com/) site dedicated to discussion of the manifesto, and a poll that it hosts suggests that opinion is indeed varied. I have embedded the same poll below if you would like to voice your opinion right now.

I am just happy to see some activity taking place within the SOA community, and for SOA to be getting some form of press once again. SOA has provided a great deal of benefit to the many organisations that have embraced it, and I believe that fact should be recognised. If you too believe in the benefits that SOA delivers you should head on over to the [site](http://www.soa-manifesto.org/), and if you agree with what is written become a signatory to the manifesto.
