When dealing with a database you need to be aware of any differences between how a data type is represented in your programming language and how it is stored in the database. These differences may not be noticeable at first but often surface later, when a query is not returning the expected results, or a round-tripped value is no longer exactly equal to the original value stored. The `DateTime` data type in .NET has a fairly high precision of 100-nanoseconds per tick and is a candidate for such issues.

> Time values are measured in 100-nanosecond units called ticks, and a particular date is the number of ticks since 12:00 midnight, January 1, 0001 A.D. (C.E.) in the [GregorianCalendar](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.globalization.gregoriancalendar.aspx) calendar (excluding ticks that would be added by leap seconds).

Even with SQL Server there was a considerable difference in precision prior to the introduction of the `DATETIME2` data type, given that `DATETIME` values are stored with a precision of 3.33 milliseconds. When the required level of precision cannot find its way into the database to be round-tripped without loss a workaround needs to be created.

[MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/) stores data in a [BSON](http://bsonspec.org/) format, which is a binary representation of the popular [JSON](http://json.org/) format. The specification indicates that a UTC datetime value is stored as a 64-bit signed integer representing the number of milliseconds since the Unix epoch. Once again we have a mismatch in precision to the `DateTime` data type in .NET and need to find a workaround for this difference.

The officially supported [C\# driver for MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/CSharp+Language+Center) provides us with some options when it comes to serializing `DateTime` values into the their BSON representation. Fortunately, one of these options is able to assist with the handling of precision without resorting to storing values in a different .NET data type. Lets have a look at how `DateTime` values are stored by working with a very simple object that has a single `DateTime` property called `Timestamp`. We will let MongoDB assign an Id value for the document.

```csharp
public class Record
{
    public Guid Id { get; set; }

    public DateTime Timestamp { get; set; }
}
```

We will also need to write some code to insert a record so that we can have a look at the stored value. The code below creates a _records_ collection in the *test*database of the local server. It then inserts a new `Record` document into the collection after ensuring that the collection is empty to begin with.

```csharp
MongoServer server = MongoServer.Create("mongodb://localhost");
MongoDatabase database = server.GetDatabase("test");

MongoCollection<BsonDocument> records = database.GetCollection("records");
records.Drop(); // Remove any existing documents.

Record record = new Record {Timestamp = DateTime.UtcNow};
records.Insert(record);

server.Disconnect();
```

The result is a document with a `Timestamp` property that is saved using a call to `ISODate`. This is simply a helper function and the provided datetime will be stored as an integer value as per the BSON specification.

```json
{ "_id" : ObjectId("4e848461d0ba9f8047c27dc7"), "Timestamp" : ISODate("2011-09-29T14:44:49.172Z") }
```

To gain further control of the serialization the `BsonDateTimeOptionsAttribute` can be applied to a `DateTime` property. The attribute has three properties: `DateOnly`, `Kind` and `Representation`. Setting the `DateOnly` property to `true` causes the time of day component to be stored as zero, and setting the `Kind` property allows us to store the `DateTimeKind`. These first two options are not going to help us with our precision issues but are obviously useful for other scenarios. It is setting the third option of `Representation` to `BsonType.Document` that will allow us to keep our tick level precision.

```csharp
public class Record
{
    public Guid Id { get; set; }

    [BsonDateTimeOptions(Representation = BsonType.Document)]
    public DateTime Timestamp { get; set; }
}
```

After applying the attribute to our `Timestamp` property we can see that the value is now persisted in a format that includes the value from the `Ticks` property of the `DateTime`. This special handling of the `BsonType.Document` representation is being handled by the `DateTimeSerializer` class in the driver.

```json
{ "_id" : ObjectId("4e848714d0ba9f8047c27dc8"), "Timestamp" : { "DateTime" : ISODate("2011-09-29T14:56:20.481Z"), "Ticks" : NumberLong("634529049804813857") } }
```

Instead of applying the attribute to each `DateTime` property it is possible to specify the default serialization behaviour by setting the `DateTimeSerializationOptions.Default` property.

```csharp
DateTimeSerializationOptions.Defaults = new DateTimeSerializationOptions(DateTimeKind.Utc, BsonType.Document);
```

Now that we have the `DateTime` value stored with the desired precision we need to be aware of this document format when it comes time to query the values. In order to perform comparisons in a query we will compare the `Ticks` property of the reference `DateTime` to the `Ticks` property of the stored `DateTime` element.

```csharp
DateTime utcNow = DateTime.UtcNow;
Record insertedRecord = new Record {Timestamp = utcNow};
records.Insert(insertedRecord);

QueryComplete query = Query.EQ("Timestamp.Ticks", utcNow.Ticks);
Record queriedRecord = records.FindOneAs<Record>(query);
Console.WriteLine(insertedRecord.Timestamp.Ticks == queriedRecord.Timestamp.Ticks);
```

The same technique can be used with the other comparison operators such as GT, GTE, LT and LTE. You can always encapsulate these details into a simple helper class like the sample below for the comparisons you require.

```csharp
public static class DateTimeQuery
{
    public static QueryComplete EQ(string name, DateTime value)
    {
        return new QueryComplete(new BsonDocument(GetTicksName(name), value.Ticks));
    }

    public static QueryConditionList GT(string name, DateTime value)
    {
        return new QueryConditionList(GetTicksName(name)).GT(value.Ticks);
    }

    public static QueryConditionList GTE(string name, DateTime value)
    {
        return new QueryConditionList(GetTicksName(name)).GTE(value.Ticks);
    }

    public static QueryConditionList LT(string name, DateTime value)
    {
        return new QueryConditionList(GetTicksName(name)).LT(value.Ticks);
    }

    public static QueryConditionList LTE(string name, DateTime value)
    {
        return new QueryConditionList(GetTicksName(name)).LTE(value.Ticks);
    }

    static string GetTicksName(string name)
    {
        return name.EndsWith(".Ticks") ? name : name + ".Ticks";
    }
}
```

This lets you query directly on the property name and provide the `DateTime` value. No worrying about ticks.

```csharp
QueryComplete query = DateTimeQuery.EQ("Timestamp", utcNow);
Record queriedRecord = records.FindOneAs<Record>(query);
```

The end result seems reasonable. Persisted `DateTime` values keep full precision and are deserialized into a `DateTime` value. Querying for the data becomes a little more difficult but some helpers can reduce the friction. These results were confirmed using MongoDB 2.0.0 and the MongoDB C\# Driver 1.2.0.4274.
