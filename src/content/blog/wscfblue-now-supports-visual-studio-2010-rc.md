There is another WSCF.blue update (V1.0.7) available for [download](http://wscfblue.codeplex.com/releases/view/40987) on CodePlex. This update adds support for Visual Studio 2010 RC in addition to Visual Studio 2008. Please note that Visual Studio 2010 Beta 2 is not supported.

All features should work exactly the same way in both versions of Visual Studio. If you have any problems please jump onto the [Issue Tracker](http://wscfblue.codeplex.com/WorkItem/List.aspx) and let us know.

I would also love to hear more about what features you would like to see in upcoming versions of WSCF.blue. If you have any thoughts please contact me or simply start a thread in the [Discussions](http://wscfblue.codeplex.com/Thread/List.aspx) forum. Your feedback is always welcome.
